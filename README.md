OOP Assignment:-
Challenge 1: Square Numbers and Return Their Sum
ðŸ”´ In this challenge, you need to implement a method that squares passing variables and returns their sum.

Problem statement: Implement a class Point that has three properties and a method. All these attributes (properties and methods) should be public. This problem can be broken down into two tasks:

Task 1: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a constructor to initialize the values of three properties: x, y, and z.

Task 2: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a method, sqSum(), in the Point class which squares x, y, and z and returns their sum.

Sample properties 1, 3, 5

Sample method output 35

image1

Coding exercise Create a class Point with three properties: x, y, and z.

class Point:

    def __init__(self):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

    def sqSum(self):
        pass
Challenge 2: Implement a Calculator Class
ðŸ”´ In this exercise, you have to implement a calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Problem statement Write a Python class called Calculator by completing the tasks below:

Task 1

ðŸ‘‰ Initializer

Implement an initializer to initialize the values of num1 and num2. Properties

â€¢ num1
â€¢ num2
Task 2

ðŸ‘‰ Methods

â€¢ add() is a method that returns the sum of num1 and num2.
â€¢ subtract() is a method that returns the subtraction of num1 from num2.
â€¢ multiply() is a method that returns the product of num1 and num2.
â€¢ divide() is a method that returns the division of num2 by num1.
Input - Pass numbers (integers or floats) in the initializer.

Output - addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication

Sample input

obj = Calculator(10, 94)
obj.add()
obj.subtract()
obj.multiply()
obj.divide()
Sample output

104
84
940
9.4
Coding exercise

class Calculator:

    def __init__(self):
        pass
    def add(self):
        pass
    def subtract(self):
        pass
    def multiply(self):
        pass
    def divide(self):
        pass
Challenge 3: Implement the Complete Student Class
ðŸ”´In this challenge, you will implement a student class
Problem statement

Implement the complete Student class by completing the tasks below

Task

ðŸ‘‰ Implement the following properties as private:

â€¢ name
â€¢ rollNumber
ðŸ‘‰ Include the following methods to get and set the private properties above:

â€¢ getName()
â€¢ setName()
â€¢ getRollNumber()
â€¢ setRollNumber()
ðŸ‘‰ Implement this class according to the rules of encapsulation.

Input - Checking all the properties and methods

Output - Expecting perfectly defined fields and getter/setters

Note: Do not use initializers to initialize the properties. Use the set methods to do so.

If the setter is not defined properly, the corresponding getter will also generate an error even if the getter is defined properly.

Coding exercise

class Student:

    def setName(self):
        pass
    def getName(self):
        pass
    def setRollNumber(self):
        pass
    def getRollNumber(self):
        pass
Challenge 4: Implement a Banking Account
ðŸ”´ In this challenge, you will implement a banking account using the concepts of inheritance.
Problem statement

Implement the basic structure of a parent class, Account, and a child class, SavingsAccount.

Task 1

ðŸ‘‰ Implement properties as instance variables, and set them to None or 0.

Account has the following properties:

    â€¢ title
    â€¢ Balance
SavingsAccount has the following properties:

    â€¢ interestRate
Task 2

Create an initializer for Account class. The order of parameters should be the following, where Ashish is the title, and 5000 is the account balance:

Account("Ashish", 5000)

Task 3

Implement properties as instance variables, and set them to None or 0.

Create an initializer for the SavingsAccount class using the initializer of the Account class in the order below:

Account("Ashish", 5000, 5)

Here, Ashish is the title and 5000 is the balance and 5 is the interestRate.

Coding exercise

class Account:

    def __init__(self):
        # write your code here
        pass

class SavingsAccount():

    def __init__(self):
        # write your code here
        Pass
Challenge 5: Handling a Bank Account
ðŸ”´ In this challenge, you will define methods for handling a bank account using concepts of inheritance.

Problem statement

In this challenge, we will be extending the previous challenge and implementing methods in the parent class and its corresponding child class.

The initializers for both classes have been defined for you.

Task 1

In the Account class, implement the getBalance() method that returns balance.

Task 2

In the Account class, implement the deposit(amount) method that adds amount to the balance.

It does not return anything.

Sample input

balance = 2000
deposit(500)
getbalance()
Sample output

2500
Task 3

In the Account class, implement the withdrawal(amount) method that subtracts the amount from the balance.

It does not return anything.

Sample input

balance = 2000
withdrawal(500)
getbalance()
Sample output

1500
Task 4

In the SavingsAccount class, implement an interestAmount() method that returns the interest amount of the current balance.

Below is the formula for calculating the interest amount:

image1

Sample input

balance = 2000
interestRate = 5
interestAmount()
Sample output

100
The following figure shows what the result should logically look like:

Coding exercise

Note: A new SavingsClass object is initialized at the end of the code and test results will be based on it.

class Account:
    def __init__(self, title=None, balance=0):
        self.title = title
        self.balance = balance
    
    def withdrawal(self, amount):
        # write code here
        pass

    def deposit(self, amount):
        # write code here
        pass
    def getBalance(self):
        # write code here
        pass

class SavingsAccount(Account):
    def __init__(self, title=None, balance=0, interestRate=0):
            super().__init__(title, balance)
            self.interestRate = interestRate
    
    def interestAmount(self):
        # write code here
        pass

#code to test - do not edit this

demo1 = SavingsAccount("Ashish", 2000, 5)   # initializing a SavingsAccount object
